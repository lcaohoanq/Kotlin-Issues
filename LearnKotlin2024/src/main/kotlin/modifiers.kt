/*
    - public (default in Kotlin): if any class, interface are not specified with any modifier, it is public by default,
     if any member of class are not specified with any modifier, it is public by default
    - private
    - protected
    - internal: visible inside the same module
    
    - open: in kotlin all classes are final by default, so you can't be inherited, 
    if you want to inherit from a class, you must use "open" keyword. 
    It's the opposite of final in Java (when need to manually make class final explicitly)
